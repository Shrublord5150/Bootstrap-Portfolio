                    <p>Greetings and salutations! As you can already tell from this page my name is Daniel Murphy, and currently,
                        I am learning how to code! So far the learning process has been a roller coaster with several ups
                        and downs, but once that piece of code finally works, well there's nothing quite like that feeling.</p>

                    <p>So a little bit about me...where to begin? Well, I graduated from UCF with a degree in Psychology
                        way back in May of 2013. If I am being honest, I became bored with Psychology during my Junior year
                        but decided to finish up the degree because I didn't really know what else to do. After graduation,
                        I left my psychology degree to the dust on my wall and ventured into various fields of work including
                        financial work (as an assistant or file keeper or whatever), insurance, and food service. All these
                        jobs were fun and interesting at first, but after a while, I felt the need to move on.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                        <p>I re-enrolled at UCF in the fall of 2015, this time with my sights set on an English degree with
                            a focus in Technical Communication or Technical Writing. I stumbled onto the technical writing
                            path through my interest in creative writing and while I was searching for some type of freelance
                            writing job, I kept finding positions for "Technical Writers". After a few minutes of Google
                            research, I came to the conclusion that technical writing was something I could learn to do that
                            would allow me to hone certain writing skills while also providing me with a creative outlet.
                            The paycheck for these positions was a nice motivator too. Needless to say, I was headed back
                            to UCF.
                        </p>

                        <p>While in the last semester of my technical writing degree, I enrolled in a beginners coding class
                            which taught HTML and CSS. At the beginning of the course, I thought I might have made a mistake
                            as the majority of the students were I.T. majors and most of them already had a strong understanding
                            of web development. After a few weeks of delving into the process, I began to feel more comfortable
                            with coding and soon coding class became my favorite. A few months later I graduated with my
                            degree in technical writing, and now I am enrolled in this coding Bootcamp to learn what it takes
                            to become a full stack web developer.</p>

                        <p>The reason I enjoy coding so much is that the process of learning it resembles that of learning
                            a new instrument or song. Music is a huge passion of mine and whenever I start learning a new
                            song on piano or guitar, often times my hands can't quite sync up differing rhythms. It starts
                            slowly and painfully and can be disheartening at times, but when both hands finally start flowing
                            and work perfectly together, a song is produced. And there is no greater feeling when all the
                            hard work finally pays off. For me, the coding process is exactly the same. It can be frustrating
                            and difficult at first, but when your code finally works...well, its like music to my ears.</p>
